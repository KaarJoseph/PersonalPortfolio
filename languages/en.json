    "title-proyecto1": "EmotionLens: Emotion Recognition System",
    "info-proyecto1": "A mobile application developed in Android Studio with Java, which uses computer vision algorithms for facial recognition. It uses Haar cascades to detect face, eyes, nose, and mouth. With these points, it calculates descriptors (such as HOG or similar), sends them to a web server implemented in Flask, where an SVM model predicts the user's emotion. Additionally, the application applies an interactive filter (like virtual glasses) to enhance the visual and educational experience. This system is ideal for educational projects and social interaction.",
    "title-proyecto2": "Personal Portfolio",
    "info-proyecto2": "My personal portfolio, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a space where I showcase my most outstanding projects interactively, including functional deployments and links to the corresponding repositories. It reflects my knowledge in technologies like React, Flask, Django, databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, and tools like Git. The design is responsive and modern, also highlighting my academic background, certifications, and technical skills in frontend and backend development, consolidating my experience in programming and web development.",
    "title-proyecto3": "AMIRA: Connecting with Your Well-being",
    "info-proyecto3": "AMIRA is an emotional assistant designed to interact with students through a chat, collecting key information from conversations. It uses advanced text analysis techniques to identify patterns related to anxiety, depression, and stress. Based on this data, AMIRA generates an emotional pre-diagnosis, offering an innovative tool to promote well-being and facilitate timely interventions in the educational field.",
